          <p class="actualBio">
            I am a Junior at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools in Chicago, Illinois with a passion for economics, computer science, and leadership. <br><br>
            I am the president and founder of U-High's nationally-ranked Ethics Bowl team, which competes with other schools from Chicago and around the nation to debate ethically-relevant topics. To find the cases we discussed this year, click <a id="ethicsBowlCases" href="https://nhseb.unc.edu/files/2017/09/2017-2018-Regional-Cases.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br>
            I serve as the All-School Treasurer for U-High's Student Council, which entails managing over $22,000 in school funds that are used for club events, school dances, community building, and class-wide community events. To see a more detailed breakdown of our 2017-2018 budget, click <a id="studCoFinances" href="https://sc.ucls.uchicago.edu/about/finances.php" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>

      <p class="footerText" id="SJQuote">Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.<br> —Steve Jobs</p>

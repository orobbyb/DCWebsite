      <p id="quoteDescription">Everybody has days when they need a boost. Often times, people lose sight of what really matters, and they get caught up thinking about small, material things that, in the long run, aren't really important. I think it's really important that people don't sweat the small stuff, but rather look at matters from a distance on occasion.
        In order to center myself when doing that, I often read quotes that I've collected over time. Whenever I see something that I think is inspirational, I write it down so that I can find it when I need to refocus. Below, I've shared a few quotes that I've found to be extremely helpful, especially throughout High School.
        The beauty of quotes is that you can make whatever you want of them, so your interpretation might be totally different from mine. Regardless, read on, and I hope you find yourself refocused and full of energy to inspire yourself and others. <br><br>
        In addition to quotes, poetry can be another way to recenter yourself and remind yourself of what's important. To read an anthology of poems that I put together, click <a id="anthology" href="assets/documents/anthology.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <p class="footerText" id="SJQuote">Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.<br> —Steve Jobs</p>
